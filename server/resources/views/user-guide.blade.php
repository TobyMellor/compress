                        News Articles are long.<br /><br />
                        Many readers are drawn in by the mis-leading headline, and put off by the long article body.<br /><br />
                        ComPress takes articles that you like the most, and ComPresses them down into short and long summaries.<br /><br />
                        The latest articles are pulled in from across many News Outlets and Genres you choose, all in one place.

                        Articles are first displayed as you'd see them on a News website; with the title, the authors summary and an image to draw you in.<br /><br />
                        Clicking into the Article reveals it ComPressed short summary. From here you can go to the Article directly and/or take a look at the long summary.<br /><br />
